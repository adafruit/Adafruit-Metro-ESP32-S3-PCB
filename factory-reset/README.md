## Factory Reset file - Metro ESP32-S3 with 16 MB Flash 8MB PSRAM

This is the factory reset file for the Metro ESP32-S3 with 16 MB Flash 8MB PSRAM Rev B.

<b>As of Nov 8, 2023</b>Â - We've fixed this hardware to be revision B which has changed the NeoPixel pin and the SPI/SD card pins to no longer use the same pins as the octal PSRAM. This means that the hardware now works correctly when PSRAM is activated! <b>If you have a rev A hardware board, contact support to get a replacement rev B.</b>
